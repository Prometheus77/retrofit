Title: Retrofits a model score to another model

Description: When replacing an old model with a new one it is often desirable to
  retrofit the new model to the old so that a given score is expected to yield
  the same result in both models. This package takes a set of predictions and 
  truth from two models and returns a function that converts the results of 
  the second model into an equivalent score matching the expected performance
  of the first model.
